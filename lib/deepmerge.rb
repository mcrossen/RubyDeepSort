### Deep Merge Utility
## Over View
# when included into a project, this utility gives Arrays and Hashes the ability to deeply merge with other arrays and hashes
# instead of shallow merges, deep_merge recursively merges each nested array and hash.
# this does mean that the hashes and arrays must have similar structures.

module DeepMerge
  # inject this method into the Array class to add deep merging functionality to Arrays
  module DeepMergeArray
    def deep_merge(other)
      (self+other).uniq
    end

    def deep_merge!(other)
      # in ruby, uniq! returns nil if there are no changes unlike uniq which returns the array
      # because of this uniq has to be used here with a replacement instead of uniq!
      replace(concat(other).uniq)
    end
  end

  # inject this method into the Hash class to add deep merge functionality to Hashes
  module DeepMergeHash
    def deep_merge(other)
      merge(other) do |_key, oldval, newval|
        if oldval.respond_to? :deep_merge
          oldval.deep_merge(newval)
        else
          newval
        end
      end
    end

    def deep_merge!(other)
      merge!(other) do |_key, oldval, newval|
        if oldval.respond_to? :deep_merge!
          oldval.deep_merge!(newval)
        else
          newval
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

Array.send(:include, DeepMerge::DeepMergeArray)
Hash.send(:include, DeepMerge::DeepMergeHash)


# and if you don't like calling member methods on objects, these two functions do it for you.
def deep_merge(source, other)
  if source.respond_to? :deep_merge
    source.deep_merge(other)
  else
    other
  end
end

# similar to the deep_merge method, but performs the deep merge in place
def deep_merge!(source, other)
  if source.respond_to? :deep_merge
    source.deep_merge!(other)
  else
    other
  end
end
